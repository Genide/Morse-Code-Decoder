# Morse-Code-Decorder
This repository will have all my code and research in decoding all possible solutions of a Morse code problem.

The problem is as follows. Suppose that a soldier wants to send a critical message in morse code. 
But the soldier doesn't have time to leave spaces in between each character. 
So the job of the lonely programmer is to provide all the different possible solutions of a morse code in a time/space efficient manner.

The program is written in Java, but the analysis of the algorithm is in a separate file.
In order to use this program, just compile and run it. 
It will ask for a Morse Code. Input "." for dots and "-" for dashes. Do not use any spaces.
The program will create a new text file in the same folder as the source code.
The text file's name will be dependent on the code that you input. 
A code of "...---..." will result in a text file named "OOOAAAOOO".
O for "." and A for "-".
The text file will hold all possible ways to decode the morse code that was inputed.

Keep in mind that this Java project was written in IntelliJ, but all code should compile regardless of what IDE is used.
